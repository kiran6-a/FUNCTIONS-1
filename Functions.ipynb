        "--> The return statement in a Python function serves a couple of important purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Output a Value:\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows the function to send a value back to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add(2, 3)  # result will be 5\n",
        "Terminate a Function:\n",
        "\n",
        "It stops the function's execution and exits, optionally returning a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "def check_number(num):\n",
        "    if num > 0:\n",
        "        return \"Positive\"\n",

        "result = check_number(-5)  # result will be \"Non-positive\"\n",
        "Without the return statement, a function would return None by default. It's essential for passing results or outcomes from a function's processing back to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "--> Iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts in Python. Here's a concise explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterables:\n",
        "Definition: Objects that can be looped over (iterated) using a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Special Method: Must implement the __iter__() method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: Any object that you can iterate over using a for loop is an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "for item in my_list:\n",
        "    print(item)\n",
        "Iterators:\n",
        "Definition: Objects that represent a stream of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Special Methods: Must implement two methods: __iter__() and __next__().\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage: Produced by calling iter() on an iterable. Use next() to get the next item.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "Iterable: Can be converted to an iterator using iter(). Examples include lists and strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterator: Can fetch items one at a time using next(). Keeps track of its position during iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "--> Generators in Python are a special type of iterators that allow you to iterate over data in a memory-efficient manner. Instead of storing all the values in memory at once, generators generate values on the fly, one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features:\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators produce items only when requested, which makes them memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Retention: They maintain their state between each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining Generators:\n",
        "Generator Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defined like regular functions but use the yield statement instead of return.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "def count_up_to(max_value):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max_value:\n",
        "        yield count\n",
        "        count += 1\n",
        "\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "for num in counter:\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "Generator Expressions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "squared_numbers = (x * x for x in range(5))\n",
        "for num in squared_numbers:\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "--> Generators offer several advantages over regular functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators produce items one at a time and only when needed, which saves memory. Regular functions that return lists hold all elements in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators yield values on-the-fly. This lazy evaluation allows processing of large datasets that wouldn't fit into memory all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators often lead to faster and more responsive programs because they avoid the overhead of creating and storing all elements upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "State Retention:\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators maintain their state between iterations, which can simplify the implementation of stateful iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplified Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "Using yield in generators can simplify the code needed for producing sequences, compared to managing list append operations in regular functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are particularly useful for tasks such as reading large files line-by-line, streaming data, and implementing infinite sequences. They offer an elegant and efficient way to handle data processing with minimal memory usage and improved performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "def square_numbers(n):\n",
        "    result = []\n",
        "    for i in range(n):\n",
        "        result.append(i * i)\n",
        "    return result\n",
        "\n",
        "squares = square_numbers(5)\n",
        "for num in squares:\n",
        "    print(num)\n",
        "\n",
        " 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "--> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can have any number of input parameters but only one expression. It's used for creating small, one-off functions without needing to formally define a function using the def keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "python\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
        "Typical Uses:\n",
        "Short, throwaway functions: When a small function is needed temporarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "squared = list(map(lambda x: x * x, numbers))\n",
        "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
        "Sorting: Custom sorting logic can be implemented using lambda as the key function.\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "points = [(2, 3), (1, 2), (4, 1)]\n",
        "points_sorted = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1])\n",
        "print(points_sorted)  # Output: [(4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]\n",
        "Filtering: Using filter() to remove elements based on a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
        "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
        "Lambda functions are handy for concise operations and are often used when the function is simple and used only a few times. They help keep the code clean and readable without the overhead of formal function definitions.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "-->The map() function in Python is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or a tuple) and return a map object (an iterator) of the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Transformation: It allows you to transform and process each element of an iterable without writing explicit loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
        "function: The function to apply to each element of the iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "iterable: One or more iterables to apply the function to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Here’s a simple example to double each number in a list:\n",
        "\n",
        "def double(x):\n",
        "    return x * 2\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "doubled_numbers = map(double, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(list(doubled_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
        "Using Lambda with map():\n",
        "For concise operations, lambda functions are often used with map():\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "doubled_numbers = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)\n",
        "\n",
        "print(list(doubled_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
        "Multiple Iterables:\n",
        "You can also use map() with multiple iterables. The function will be applied to elements from each iterable in parallel:\n",
        "\n",
        "numbers1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "numbers2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
        "summed_numbers = map(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers1, numbers2)\n",

        "--> These three functions are key tools for functional programming in Python, each serving a distinct purpose:\n",
        "\n",
